#Shortest Path Maintenance Algorithm Documentation

##Introduction

The Shortest Path Maintenance Algorithm is designed to efficiently maintain the shortest path tree in a graph when changes are made to the graph by inserting or deleting edges. The algorithm utilizes the CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) format to represent the graph and performs incremental updates to the shortest path tree without the need for a complete graph recalculation.

##Algorithm Overview
The algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. Parse the original input Matrix Market file: The algorithm starts by parsing the original input graph file in the Matrix Market format. The graph is represented using the CSR format to efficiently store and access the graph data.
1. Generate the Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) tree: Using Dijkstra's algorithm, the algorithm generates the SSSP tree from the original graph. The SSSP tree represents the shortest path from a specified source node to all other nodes in the graph.
1. Load the SSSP CSR matrix into memory: The SSSP CSR matrix, obtained from the previous step, is loaded into memory. This allows for efficient access and updates during the subsequent steps.
1. Parse the output file containing modified edges: The algorithm parses the output file generated by the "mtxToChangedEdges.cpp" script. This file contains the modified edges in the Matrix Market format, along with the corresponding changes (insertions or deletions) indicated by specific values.
1. Update the CSR matrix: For each modified edge, the algorithm identifies the source and destination vertices. It checks if these vertices are affected by the modification. If so, the corresponding row and column in the CSR matrix are updated with the new edge weight or marked as deleted (-1).
1. Update the shortest path tree: After updating the CSR matrix, the algorithm traverses the modified edges and applies the necessary changes to the shortest path tree. For insertions, the edge and its weight are added to the shortest path tree. For deletions, the edge is removed from the shortest path tree.
1. Updated shortest path tree: The algorithm produces the updated shortest path tree, which reflects the changes made by the modified edges. This updated tree can be used to efficiently answer shortest path queries without recalculating the entire graph.

##Functions and Data Structures

###convertToCSR

```
std::vector<std::vector<Edge>> convertToCSR(std::ifstream& inputFile)
```
* Description: This function converts the input graph file in the Matrix Market format to the CSR representation.
* Input: inputFile - The input file stream containing the graph data in Matrix Market format.
* Output: Returns a vector of vectors representing the CSR matrix of the graph.

###dijkstra
```
std::vector<double> dijkstra(const std::vector<std::vector<Edge>>& graphCSR, int sourceNode)
```
* Description: This function performs Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the single source shortest path from the given source node.
* Inputs:
* graphCSR - The CSR matrix representation of the graph.
* sourceNode - The source node from which to compute the shortest path.
* Output: Returns a vector representing the shortest distances from the source node to all other nodes.

###updateShortestPath
```
void updateShortestPath(std::vector<double>& shortestPath, const std::vector<std::vector<Edge>>& changedEdgesCSR)
```
* Description: This function updates the shortest path tree based on the modifications made to the graph.
* Inputs:
* shortestPath - The vector representing the shortest distances from the source node to all other nodes.
* changedEdgesCSR - The CSR matrix representation of the modified edges.
* Output: Modifies the shortestPath vector in-place to reflect the updated shortest path tree.

###main
```
int main(int argc, char** argv)
```
* Description: The main function of the program that orchestrates the shortest path maintenance algorithm.
* Inputs: Command-line arguments specifying the input graph file, changed edges file, and source node.
* Output: Prints or stores the updated shortest path tree.

###Example Usage
Here is an example command to run the program:
```
./shortest_path -g input_graph.mtx -c changed_edges.mtx -s 1```

* -g input_graph.mtx: Specifies the input graph file in the Matrix Market format.
* -c changed_edges.mtx: Specifies the output file generated by "mtxToChangedEdges.cpp" containing the modified edges.
* -s 1: Specifies the source node for computing the shortest path.

##Time Complexity

The time complexity of the Shortest Path Maintenance Algorithm can be analyzed as follows:

* Parsing the original input graph file and generating the SSSP in CSR format using Dijkstra's algorithm: O(V^2 + E log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
* Parsing the output file containing the modified edges: O(M), where M is the number of modified edges.
* Updating the CSR matrix and the shortest path tree: O(M), where M is the number of modified edges.

The overall time complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the step involving the Dijkstra's algorithm, as it has a complexity of O(V^2 + E log V). The remaining steps have linear time complexity with respect to the number of modified edges.

##Conclusion

The Shortest Path Maintenance Algorithm provides an efficient approach to update the shortest path tree when changes are made to the graph. By leveraging the CSR format and incremental updates, the algorithm avoids the need for recalculating the entire graph, resulting in improved performance for maintaining the shortest path.
